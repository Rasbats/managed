= CI Final checks and testing

== Final checks

Have the environment variables been entered for CircleCI, Drone,
Travis and Appveyor?

xref:../InstallConfigure/Builders/CircleCI.adoc[CircleCI]

xref:../InstallConfigure/Builders/Drone.adoc[Drone] or: xref:../InstallConfigure/Builders/Travis.adoc[Travis]

xref:../InstallConfigure/Builders/Appveyor.adoc[Appveyor]

Has a deploy key (with write permissions) been added to your
OpenCPN/plugins fork repo?

xref:../InstallConfigure/GithubPreps.adoc[Github preparations]

Are the Cloudsmith repos ready to receive your builds?

xref:../InstallConfigure/Cloudsmith.adoc[Cloudsmith]

Is  the OpenCPN/plugins for ready to accept pushed metadata from
the builders?

xref:../InstallConfigure/Catalog-Github-Integration.adoc[Integrating the Catalog with Github]

== Building the plugin

The builds start with pushing a change to the TideFinder repository.

When the changes have been made to the plugin it is a good idea to make
an untagged build. The builds will arrive in the Cloudsmith
opencpn/tidefinder-alpha repository. The plugin can be tested for
functionality by using the *Import plugin…* button in OpenCPN.

Now a tagged beta build can be made. The tag name needs to include the
word `beta'. For example `v1.2.5-beta' This build pushes the plugin
tarballs and metadata xml files to Cloudsmith opencpn/tidefinder-beta.
At the same time the metadata files are pushed to the auto branch of
your GitHub OpenCPN/plugins fork repo.

The beta build can be tested in the same way as the experimental
untagged version. Use the *Import plugin…* button in OpenCPN.

When you want the plugin to be added to the master catalog another
tagged build is made. The tag name must not contain `beta'. For example
`v1.2.5'. The source code for tagged builds, either beta or production
ends up in GitHub TideFinder repo tag pages. The reason for using
untagged builds initially is to avoid cluttering up this part of your
GitHub repo. Unwanted tags can be removed 
xref:Useful-Stuff.adoc[using this technique]

== Check the metadata push

Check that the builders pushes metadata to the OpenCPN/plugins fork

    $ cd plugins
    $ git log --oneline auto~10..auto

This lists the 10 last commit to the auto branch. You should see something
like

    75c771bf 1a21bbc: raspbian-armhf: refactor-2
    b1afafc5 1a21bbc: raspbian-armhf: refactor-2
    d94cbb81 1a21bbc: mingw-x86_64: refactor-2
    8b35bdc6 1a21bbc: ubuntu-x86_64: refactor-2
    77ba0dbf 1a21bbc: debian-x86_64: refactor-2

Don't care that much about the commit messages. The important thing is
that the builders actually have pushed commits to the auto branch.


== Pull request from plugins

The final part after checking that the tarballs are in place at Cloudsmith
and the metadata is pushed is to make a Pull Request against the
plugin catatalog to make plugins available to end users. This is described
in the xref:InstallConfigure/Catalog-Github-Integration.adoc#make-PR[metadata push page]
