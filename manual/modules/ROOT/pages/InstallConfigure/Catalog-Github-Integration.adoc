= Automatic Metadata Git Push

Shipdriver-based plugins supports pushing metadata
to a remote git repository. The goal is to simplify the process for
creating pull requests against
https://github.com/opencpn/plugins[OpenCPN/plugins].

When enabled, all metadata files created when the plugin is built are
replicated to a fork of OpenCPN/plugins set up by the user. This fork
can be used to make a PR against OpenCPN/plugins. In particular, there
is no need to download metadata files from Cloudsmith in order to make a
PR.

== Configuration

The configuration is documented in the xref:InstallConfigure/GithubPreps.adoc[
plugins fork configuration page]

== During the build

When the builders are run, the git-push part will

* Make a clone of the OpenCPN/plugins fork repository
* Add the new metadata file.
* Commit and push the change to the auto branch in the OpenCPN/plugins
fork

As mentioned, the changes are pushed to the 'auto' branch by default.
The branch name can be tweaked using the GIT_BRANCH environment variable
in the builder.

If GIT_KEY_PASSWORD or GIT_REPO is missing git-push will not do anything
besides some logging.


== Making the Pull Request (PR) to OpenCPN/plugins [[make-PR]]

The builders have made commits in the OpenCPN/plugins fork's auto
branch, one for each build. These commits are the metadata files which
work with the plugin installer of the main OpenCPN program. In beta and
production mode they become part of the beta and master catalogs of
plugins in OpenCPN.

=== Syncing branches

Before making the pull request to OpenCPN/plugins make sure your fork of
this is up to date.
https://rick.cogley.info/post/update-your-forked-repository-directly-on-github/[This guide] has been found useful. Or on the CLI:

....
$ git remote update upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase upstream/master
$ git checkout Beta
$ git rebase upstream/Beta
....
If the Beta branch isn't used, the last two commands can be omitted.

=== Master catalog

Adding metadata files from the OpenCPN/plugins fork auto branch to the
master branch goes like this:

....
$ git fetch origin auto:auto
$ git checkout auto
$ git rebase master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --squash auto
$ git commit
....

The rebase operation should not be strictly necessary, but will pick up
possible errors if the metadata has been changed by other means. The
--squash option lumps the too many commits in the auto branch (one for
each build) to a single one, keeping the master branch tidy.

A PR (pull request) can then be made from the master branch for updating
the master catalog of OpenCPN/plugins.

=== Beta catalog

If you configured for Beta metadata files you need:

....
$ git fetch origin auto:auto
$ git checkout auto
$ git rebase Beta
$ git checkout Beta
$ git merge --squash auto
$ git commit
....

The new TideFinder metadata files have been added to your
OpenCPN/plugins fork Beta branch. A PR, if accepted, results in updating
the Beta catalog of OpenCPN/plugins.

=== Cleaning up old metadata

Normally, only the last version of the plugin should be available in the
catalog. The command

....
    $ ls -lt metadata/my-plugin*
....

lists all metadata files for given plugin in date order. Use `git rm` to
remove all older files. When completed, commit and  push:

....
    $ git commit -m "Removing obsoleted metadata."
    $ git push
....

== Troubleshooting

The _ci/git-push_ script can be run manually for debugging purposes
as described in the xref:Local-ci-build.adoc[Local CI build page]

If metadata from builds does not show up in the auto branch:

1. First check the build logs: does the git-push step complete? Last 
part of the git-push message is something like
+
    To github.com:leamas/plugins.git
       6beead5..8c0a9a9  auto -> auto
+
which means that auto branch is updated to 8c0a9a9 . Remember that commit
+
2. In the OpenCPN/plugins clone check that commit:
+
     $ git fetch origin
     $ git show 8c0a9a9
+
This will display the actual changes to the metadata file. Are they sound?
+
3. Check the metadata file using some editor, it lives in the metadata directory. 
If it's fine: done.
+
4. If it's not as expected: check the log for the metadata file. Assuming this is 
about o-charts-plugin-raspbian-armhf-10.xml we do
+
    $ git log --oneline  metadata/o-charts-plugin-raspbian-armhf-10.xml
+
This should give a hint about what has happened to the file after 8c0a9a9

== Security

The private ssh key created by new-credentials is encrypted using a
standard DES alghorithm. There is probably some room to crack this given
the fact that part of ciphertext is known. The encryption would be
stronger if the header and trailer of the key wasn't encrypted.

That said, given the context this should be reasonably safe. At least, a
separate ssh key is used for this purpose, a key which could be easily
revoked.
