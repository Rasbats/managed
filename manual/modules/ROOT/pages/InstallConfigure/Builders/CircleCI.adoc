Add the Environment Variable for Cloudsmith - this is the
CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY that was saved previously

Use the plugins clone SSH url and the password you used for making the
keys to create further Environment Variables in the CircleCI TideFinder
project.

*The build fails at the moment because GitHub was not updated with the

Circleci requires user to manually request a MacOS builder before it can
be used. This process has been working flawlessly.
