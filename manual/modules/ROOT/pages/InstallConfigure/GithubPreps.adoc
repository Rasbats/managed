= Github OpenCPN/plugins fork

The shipdriver workflow requires that developer has cloned
link:https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins[OpenCPN/plugins]. During
builds, metadata files are automatically pushed to this clone. This page
describes how this is configured. 

The result is the two environment variables GIT_REPO and GIT_KEY_PASSWORD.
These variables are used when configuring builders.

If maintaining several plugins, this is a one time setup. If there already
is a plugin setup  according to steps below, copy the files 
_build-deps/username.enc_ and _build-deps/username.pub_ to the current
plugin and use the same values for GIT_REPO and GIT_KEY_PASSWORD.

Otherwise, proceed as follows, First check the pre-requisites:

* A plugin. Here, TideFinder is used as example.
* A fork of
https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins.git[https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins.git]
on Github.

And then:

. Preparations: [[Preparations]]
* Windows users are best off using git-bash. However, invoking the python
scripts used here does not work out of the box. In git-bash, use the command
`alias python='winpty python.exe'` as a temporary work around before taking
more actions. See the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32597209/[Stack overflow
question] for more info including a more permanent fix.
* In the OpenCPN/plugins fork, make sure there is a remote named _upstream_.
A oneliner fixes this:

    $ git ls-remote --exit-code upstream &>/dev/null || \
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins.git

. Create a branch called _auto_ in the OpenCPN/plugins fork: [[create-auto]]
* For builds targeting the *master catalog*: drop possible existing auto
branch and create a new on top of master:
+
....
$ git branch -D auto ①
$ git remote update upstream ②
$ git checkout -b auto upstream/master ③
$ git push -f origin auto:auto ④
....
* Builds targeting the *beta catalog* is handled in a similar way:
+
....
$ git branch -D auto ①
$ git remote update upstream ②
$ git checkout -b auto upstream/Beta ③
$ git push -f origin auto:auto ④
....
+
① Remove any existing auto branch, disregard error messages. +
② Make sure our data about the github catalog is updated. +
③ Create a new branch on top of master or Beta +
④ Unconditionally overwrite the github branch
+
. You will need the ssh url to your OpenCPN/plugins fork, something like
  `git@github.com:Rasbats/plugins.git`. This can be found in the Github UI:
+
image::github/1.plugins.jpg[1.plugins.jpg]
+
Or, in the OpenCPN/plugins fork, on the command line using +
`git config --get remote.origin.url`
+
. Run _python ci/new-credentials_ in the TideFinder repo. The script
will ask for the ssh url to your plugins fork repo and a secret
password.
+
NOTE: If the script does not complete on Windows, check that the
`alias python= ...` command mentioned in xref:#Preparations[Preparations]
has been executed.
+
. Dont forget the password...
. The script will create an encrypted private + a public key named
_username.enc_ and _username.pub_ in the TideFinder _build-deps_ directory.
Commit and push these keys to Github:
+
....
   $ git add build-deps/*.enc build-deps/*.pub
   $ git commit -m "Add git deployment key."
   $ git push origin master:master
....

. In your forked "plugins" repository Register the new public key (displayed
by new-credentials) as a
deployment key with write permissions (Allow write access) on your github
OpenCPN/plugins fork repo (in Settings | Deploy keys):
+
image:github/10.deploy.key.jpg[10.deploy.key.jpg]
+
After adding the key things should look like:
+
image:github/9.deploy.key.jpg[9.deploy.key.jpg]
+
Note that despite images, the public key is indeed public; there is no
need to keep it secret.
. Take a note about GIT_REPO and GIT_KEY_PASSWORD, they are used in later
  configuration steps.
