= Github OpenCPN/plugins fork

The builders need the information generated here.

As well as creating tarball and metadata files in Cloudsmith a link with link:https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins[OpenCPN/plugins] is needed. Make a fork of this repository in your own Github repositories.

To permit the builders to push to this repository environment variables are needed for the services. A public key authorises the connection with Github.

== Providing the link to your OpenCPN/plugins fork

Run the script _ci/new-credentials_ in the TideFinder repo. The script
will ask for the ssh url to your plugins fork repo and a secret
password.

* Dont forget the passwordâ€¦
* The script will create an encrypted private + a public key in the _build-deps_
directory. Commit and push these to Github TideFinder.
* Register the new public key (displayed by new-credentials) as a
deployment key with write permissions (Allow write access) on your
github OpenCPN plugins fork repo (in Settings | Deploy keys)
