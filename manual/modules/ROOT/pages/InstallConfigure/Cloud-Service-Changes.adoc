== Cloud Service Changes

Changes are made to the plugin files and a backup
made. The GitHub TideFinder repo can be updated with the file changes.

== GitHub

The shipdriver workflow simplifies the process of updating the plugin metadata files in https://github.com/opencpn/plugins[OpenCPN/plugins].
At the same time as installers for the TideFinder plugin are made the metadata file is copied to the auto branch of your fork of OpenCPN/plugins.

After the build the changes made in your plugins clone/auto branch can be pushed to the plugins clone/master branch ready for a pull request to OpenCPN/plugins.

== Experimenting with a new build

So far none of the pushes to the GitHub TideFinder repo have been
tagged. We will continue like this as we test the build.

----
# ——– Options ———-

set(OCPN_TEST_REPO opencpn/tidefinder-alpha CACHE STRING // Default repository for untagged builds)

set(OCPN_BETA_REPO opencpn/tidefinder-beta  CACHE STRING // Default repository for tagged builds matching `beta' ) 

set(OCPN_RELEASE_REPO opencpn/tidefinder-prod CACHE STRING // Default repository for tagged builds not matching beta )
----

Make a small non-important change to one of the files and push to the GitHub TideFinder repo.

== Now check the Cloud services for errors

If any build fails the log for the builder is useful for fixing errors in the code and/or scripts.

*Appveyor*

The appveyor log shows that there is an error in Plugin.cmake.

add_library(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} SHARED ${SRC})

should read:

add_library(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} SHARED ${SRC_TIDEFINDER})


image:build.errors/1.appveyor.error.jpg[1.appveyor.error.jpg]

*Travis* 

The scripts copied from ShipDriver do not have execute permission. As a result permission to run is denied.

image:build.errors/2.travis.error.jpg[2.travis.error.jpg]

This results from copying script files from ShipDriver to TideFinder on
Windows. Permissions are not copied. To set these again the Git command
can be used for the scripts in ci/.

* git update-index –chmod=+x foo.sh
* git commit -m ``Adding execute permissions to foo.sh''
* git push

*CircleCI* 

The scripts copied from ShipDriver do not have execute
permission. As a result permission to run is denied.

image:build.errors/3.circleci.error.jpg[3.circleci.error.jpg]

Again this is due to copying files on Windows. Once set as above the
build will work.
