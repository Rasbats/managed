= Builder environment variables

All builders like CircleCI, Appveyor, Travis, etc. needs some
environment variables. The procedures for setting them varies
between the builders, see
xref:InstallConfigure/Builders/IntroCloudServiceChanges.adoc[Cloud service changes]
However, the contents of each variable is the same on all builders.
This page is a reference for these variables

Most users need to define 

* CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY
* GIT_REPO
* GIT_KEY_PASSWORD

== CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY

This is a secret available in the Cloudsmith web UI in the account
drop down top-right under the API Settings menu:

== GIT_REPO

This a public configuration item related to the metadata 
push function described in the
xref:InstallConfigure/Catalog-Github-Integration.adoc[metadata push] page.

Metadata push requires user to have forked the github repository at
https://github.com/opencpn/plugins. GIT_REPO should be set to the 
SSH-based url to this fork, something like _git@github.com:leamas/plugins.git_

The value can be obtained on the command line in the fork using 

    git config --get remote.origin.url

or using the GUI:

image::github/1.plugins.jpg[]


== GIT_KEY_PASSWORD

A secret also related  to the metadata push function described in the
xref:InstallConfigure/Catalog-Github-Integration.adoc[metadata push] page. This page
describes how to run the script _new-credentials_. GIT_KEY_PASSWORD
should be the password entered to this script.

== Custom Cloudsmith Repositories

A plugin build usually uploads to cloudsmith repositories. The
repositories used depends on the git tag attached to the build, if any. 
The repositories used by default are hardcoded in Plugin.cmake in snippets
like

....
set(OCPN_TEST_REPO "opencpn/shipdriver-alpha"
    CACHE STRING "Default repository for untagged builds"
)
set(OCPN_BETA_REPO "opencpn/shipdriver-beta"
    CACHE STRING "Default repository for tagged builds matching 'beta'"
)
set(OCPN_RELEASE_REPO "opencpn/shipdriver-prod"
    CACHE STRING "Default repository for tagged builds not matching 'beta'"
)
....

When forking a plugin, the developer hasn't permissions to upload to
these hardcoded repositories which belongs to the original owner. To fix
this, other repos could be defined using the environment variables
CLOUDSMITH_UNSTABLE_REPO, CLOUDSMITH_BETA_REPO and
CLOUDSMITH_STABLE_REPO. The values are complete repo specifications
like _alec-leamas/opencpn-plugins-unstable_.
