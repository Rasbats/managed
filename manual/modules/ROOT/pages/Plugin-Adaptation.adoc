== Adapting the legacy plugin

xref:CodeChange.adoc[Extra detail on the source code changes]

== Source Code Changes

Make the following changes to the plugin source code.

* *Use API 16:* Update the source code to use API 16.
* *Change the method for finding the data directory:* Use
GetPluginDataDir instead of GetpDataDir Examples of code changes are
[[shown here|codechange]].
* These changes should be enough for most plugins. However, more exotic
plugins might need to consider the more complete list at
https://github.com/leamas/OpenCPN/wiki/Plugin-adaptation

== Replace/add files to enable CI (Continuous Integration)

Use the 
https://github.com/Rasbats/shipdriver_pi[ShipDriver
files/directories] 
to make the changes required.

== The following directories are copied from ShipDriver to the TideFinder directory:

* .circleci
* build-deps
* ci
* flatpak (*rename org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.ShipDriver.yaml as
org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.TideFinder.yaml*)
* libs
* mingw

== This directory replaces the original in TideFinder:

* cmake

== These ShipDriver files are added to the TideFinder/ directory:

* .cmake-format.yaml
* .travis.yml
* appveyor.yml
* CI.md
* config.h.in
* COPYING
* DEPENDENCIES.md
* README-git.md
* shipdriver-plugin.xml.in (*rename as TideFinder-plugin.xml.in*)

=== Files to edit

* README.md
* CMakeLists.txt
* TideFinder-plugin.xml.in
* org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.TideFinder.yaml
* appveyor.yml

It may be easiest to use two text editor windows, one showing the
TideFinder file with the other showing ShipDriver.

== README.md

Change the building instructions and make other edits as necessary.

== CMakeLists.txt

A draft copy using ShipMaker CMakeLists.txt can be used as a template
for the new file. Edit the draft copy and substitute TideFinder for
ShipDriver. Then delete the original TideFinder file and rename the
draft copy CMakeLists.txt.

Remove `src/ocpn_plugin.h' from the source files. This is in the
libs/api-16 directory and used later, when building.

== TideFinder-plugin.xml.in

Edit this file using the ShipDriver file as a guide.

== org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.TideFinder.yaml

This file is found in the `flatpak' directory. Just 3 name
substitutions.

== appveyor.yml

Just one substitution.
