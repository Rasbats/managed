= CI services configuration

This section describes how the various services are configured. When
completed, all tarballs built are uploaded to Cloudsmith and available
for end-user downloads.

Likewise, all XML metadata files are pushed to a clone of
OpenCPN/plugins. This clone is used to create a Pull Request against
the catalog, a process which makes the plugin available to the end user.
